Task: Create an application that simulates dice rolling.

What will the application do?

The application prompts the user to roll the dice.
The application “rolls” two n-sided dice, displaying the results of each along with a total
For 6-sided dice, the application recognizes the following dice combinations and displays a message for each. It should not output this for any other size of dice.
Snake Eyes: Two 1s
Ace Deuce: A 1 and 2
Box Cars: Two 6s
Win: A total of 7 or 11
Craps: A total of 2, 3, or 12 (will also generate another message!)
